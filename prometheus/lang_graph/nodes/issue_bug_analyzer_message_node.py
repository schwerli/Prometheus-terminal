I am going to share details about an issue reported to a codebase and its related bug context.
Please analyze this bug and provide a high-level description of what needs to be changed:

1. Issue Understanding:
- Analyze the issue title, description, and comments provided
- Identify the reported symptoms and unexpected behaviors

2. Code Analysis:
- Identify which files, functions, or code blocks are involved
- Explain what the problematic code is currently doing

3. Root Cause:
- Explain why the current behavior is incorrect
- Identify which specific parts of the code are causing the issue

4. Fix Suggestion:
For each needed change, describe in plain English:
- Which file needs to be modified
- Which function or code block needs changes
- What needs to be changed (e.g., "rename variable x to y", "add null check for parameter z")
- Why this change would fix the issue

Do NOT provide actual code snippets or diffs. Focus on describing what needs to be changed.

Here are the details for analysis:

Please analyze the failure and provide a revised suggestion:

1. Error Analysis:
- Explain why the previous changes failed
- Identify what specific aspects were problematic

2. Revised Fix Suggestion:
Describe in plain English:
- Which file needs to be modified
- Which function or code block needs changes
- What needs to be changed (e.g., "rename variable x to y", "add null check for parameter z")
- Why this change would fix both the original issue and the new error
